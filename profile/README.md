## ⚙️ Recommended PC Settings
- Start with native resolution; enable DLSS/FSR or dynamic scaling if needed
- Prefer TAA/TSR for stability; sharpen moderately for clarity
- Use borderless window + frame cap for smooth alt‑tabbing
- Keep texture quality at VRAM‑safe levels; drop shadows/reflections first
- Test with a short repeatable benchmark route/mission for apples‑to‑apples changes

---

## 📦 Installation & Launcher Steps
- Link the correct launcher (Steam/Epic/EA/Ubisoft/Xbox) to your account.
- Install the base game, then select only the components you play (campaign/MP/HQ packs).
- Verify/repair files once post‑install to catch corruption early.
- Set display mode (fullscreen vs borderless), V‑Sync, and a frame cap that matches your monitor.
- Apply GPU driver updates, then rebuild shader cache by launching and idling in menus for a few minutes.

---

## 🧪 Usage Tips
- Preload where available and verify files after major patches.
- Back up save folders before modding or installing DLC.
- Tune FSR/DLSS or resolution scaling before dropping texture quality.
- Cap background apps and overlays to avoid input lag.
- Move the game to an SSD/NVMe for faster loads.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- Stutter after updates → clear shader caches and verify files
- Crashes on boot → toggle DX11/DX12/Vulkan and check overlays
- Network issues → test NAT type, disable background sync, and cap packet loss
- Save conflicts → back up local saves; prefer cloud overwrite from newest timestamp
